# Working agreement for this repo

## Keep the repo and the docs current — always, without being asked

Any change to a `.scad`, an art generator, or `build.sh` is only finished when all of
this is done, in the same pass:

1. **Regenerate the artifacts it affects.** `./build.sh` rebuilds every STL and every
   PDF; for a single part, render just that STL. Committed STLs and PDFs must match the
   source that produced them.
2. **Update the docs that state the changed fact.** Part dimensions and weights live in
   both `README.md` and the piece's own `README.md`; fit numbers and tuning advice live
   in `scale/README.md`; how the piece is played lives in `docs/how-to-use.md`. A number
   that changed in the `.scad` and not in the tables is a bug.
3. **Commit and push to `origin/main`.** No need to ask first — pushing this repo is
   pre-authorized. Commit messages in Portuguese, everything else in English.

## Verify before claiming it works

- `build.sh` is the test suite: the art generators abort on any text that crosses a cut
  line, overflows a cell or runs off the page, and `scale/scale.scad` carries `assert()`s
  on the fit. A green build is the minimum, not the proof.
- **`assert()` only checks the numbers you thought of.** When a cut or a solid changes
  shape, probe the resulting solid — intersect the part with a thin column at chosen
  coordinates and read the material height back. A paper-recess cut once shipped with a
  wrong rotation, opening a slit through the side wall: every assert passed.
- OpenSCAD's STL output is **not** deterministic — the same source rendered twice gives
  different bytes. Never compare STL hashes to decide whether geometry changed; compare
  the source, or the bounding box, or probe it.

## The fit rules that were learned the hard way

These are enforced by `assert()` in `scale/scale.scad`. Do not relax one without
understanding which failure it prevents:

- **Dovetail grip ≥ 4 × side play.** A plate that can slide sideways further than its
  ledge is deep loses engagement on one side, lifts and falls out. Plate widths are
  derived from `FIT`; never type a width by hand.
- **The paper recess is never narrower than a plate that runs over it.** Otherwise the
  plate balances on two thin ledges, stays flat while the slider holds it down, and tips
  into the recess the moment it slides out from under it.
- **A lifted plate must not reach the channel above it.** Level 1 is deliberately taller
  than the shutter needs.
- Changing `CW`, `RS` or `TUNING` means changing them in the `.scad` **and** in
  `scale/art_scale.py`. They have no shared source.

## Before asking for a 5-hour print

`scale_0-FIT-COUPON.stl` prints in ~10 minutes and tests the real cross-section. Any fit
change goes through the coupon first.
